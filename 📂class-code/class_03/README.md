# What I Learnt in This Class

In this class, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the basics of strings in Python. I learned how to work with raw strings, triple quotes, and various string operations such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting.

I also explored different string methods, including:

* `split()`: Splits a string into a list where each word is a list item.
* `join()`: Concatenates elements of an iterable into a single string.
* `strip()`, `lstrip()`, and `rstrip()`: Remove leading and/or trailing characters from a string.
* `replace()`: Replaces a specified phrase with another specified phrase.
* `find()`: Finds the first occurrence of the specified value.
* `index()`: Finds the first occurrence of the specified value.
* `count()`: Returns the number of occurrences of a specified value.
* `startswith()`: Returns True if the string starts with the specified value.
* `endswith()`: Returns True if the string ends with the specified value.

To get a better understanding of these concepts, refer to the `main.py` file in this directory, which includes examples and explanations for each of these topics.
